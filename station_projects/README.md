# Guided Learning mini projects

## Three little projects from Tumo Labs' Python Learning are included in this folder.

* The script asks for user input and generates a funny story based on the provided templates(Mad Lib).
* It is a simple game. The player should roll two dice. If the sum of both of them is 7 or 11 the player wins. 
If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 (craps) the casino wins. If during the first roll the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, 
that number becomes the “goal” number. To win, the player should roll the dice till they roll the goal number again. 
If the player rolls a 7 before rolling the goal number, they lose.
* The program takes a time from the user as a timer and start to countdown in the terminal.
